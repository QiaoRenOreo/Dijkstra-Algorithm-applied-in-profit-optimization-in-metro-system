# Dijkstra-Algorithm-applied-in-profit-optimization-in-metro-system
objective:
      use Dijkstra algorithm to find the best metro route scenario which is the most profitable for a metro company and satisfies the travel demand of consumers. 
The inputs are:
      1) the location of metro stations
      2) the lines that connect stations
      3) the frequency of vehicles
      4) capacity of vehicles
The outputs are:
      1) a trip end O-D matrix
      2) a comparison of traffic volume and transport capacity
      3) financial cost, revenue and income.
Methodology: 
      The theory underneath the application is the Four-Step Travel Demand Model. 
      It contains trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and traffic assignment.

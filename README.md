# the best metro route scenario
## Objective:
      to find the best metro route scenario which is
            the most profitable for a metro company 
            and satisfies the travel demand of consumers. 
      (by using the Four-Step Travel Demand Model and Dijkstra algorithm)
      
## Topic:
      Development of an application (in Python) for educational purposes where students can define Public Transport systems in a schematic situation in order to optimize the service (in terms of travel time for the passengers, passenger trips, exploitation costs, etc.).

## Inputs:
      1) the location of metro stations
      2) the lines that connect stations
      3) the frequency of vehicles
      4) capacity of vehicles

      
      
## Methodology: 
      The theory underneath the application is the Four-Step Travel Demand Model which contains: 
      1) trip generation
      2) trip distribution
      3) mode choice: Dijkstra algorithm is applied
      4) traffic assignment
      
## Outputs:
      1) a trip end O-D matrix
      2) a comparison of traffic volume and transport capacity
      3) financial cost, revenue and income.
